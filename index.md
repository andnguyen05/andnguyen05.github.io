## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1, part 1

    This was an enjoyable lab and my personal favorite because this started the coding foundation for myself and it was not too difficult to do. We just had to compile and run the Hello World program which wasn’t too hard but it was fun because it was my first time coding. The Hello World program was coded to have our name replace “World.”

* Lab 2, part 1

    This was another lab that I enjoyed and is my second favorite mainly because of the introduction of std::string which is integral to coding. Examples of why std::string is important is that it can be a letter, a word, or even a passage of text. I know that in the future, std::string will be something I will use a lot.

* Lab 3, part 2

    This lab is my third most favorite lab and that is because it was very complex, using formulas like the Julian Day formula to determine dates between the number of days. This was in my opinion, probably the most time consuming lab because of the many math calculations that were needed. Although it was difficult, the lab taught me that there are multiple ways to code and using algorithms from mathematics can coexist with coding.
